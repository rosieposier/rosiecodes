# rosiecodes

This is the source code for rosiecodes.

As you can probably tell from the way the site looks, I feel a lot of nostalgia for the Old Web. 

That's why I've kept the source code public. Back then I was looking for HTML and CSS snippets for my Tumblr and MySpace themes, and today I can find open-source software and public GitHub repos.

The methods may have changed but the sentiment remains the same: live, learn, and pass on.

If you do take code or inspiration from this site, please consider making your own source code public.

Rosie.
